# Flix Gradle Plugin

An experimental Gradle plugin to build [Flix language](https://flix.dev/) projects.

[![.github/workflows/build.yml](https://github.com/KengoTODA/flix-gradle-plugin/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KengoTODA/flix-gradle-plugin/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Project layout

Unlike the `flix` command, you need to locate files as follows:

* Source files should be stored under the `src/main/flix` directory.
* Test files should be stored under the `src/test/flix` directory.
